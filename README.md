A how-to guide is in the doc directory as [Using WE](./doc/UsingWE.md)

My blog article on it is at https://leaflessca.wordpress.com/2022/09/18/anomaly-detection-the-western-electric-rules/

The book is available at https://dokumen.tips/download/link/western-electrics-statistical-quality-control-handbook and a copy is in the doc directory.
